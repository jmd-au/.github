# ðŸ‘‹ G'day

I'm an AWS Cloud Engineer, interested in tinkering on the web. Have done web-dev (FE & BE), server management, EUC Support, Corporate System Management/Administration and many, (many) other things in the past.

I like making it easy to run infrastructure, and optimise for cost and efficiency. I write more in terraform than other IaC markup, purely due to the modularity available.
